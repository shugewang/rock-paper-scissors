## Experience
The project was part of the Odin project curriculum and consisted of two parts. 
In Part 1, I coded the basic mechanisms of the game in JS in browser console. Through this I learned to:
- Create a function that returns an random item from an array
- Use prompt() to get user input in a browser
- Gained greater understanding of how functions work with each other

In Part 2, I added an UI and improved the user experience of the game. In this stage I learned:
- Basic git branching and merging
- DOM methods

In addition to the features outlined in the Odin project, I also implemented the following:
- A starting page that provides a setting to the game and a start button
- Updates for each round (I limited this to the results from the most recent 3 rounds to reduce information overload)
- A 'game over' page that announces the overall winner and a replay button
- A year counter that increases by 1 after each game
